          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates. This assignment focuses on exploring correlations between obesity, smoking, lack of healthcare, poverty, age and median household income. Go ahead and explore various combinations of choices to see the degree of correlation. As well, there is additional information on each state by hovering over the circles.</p>
          <p>If you examine poverty vs. lack of healthcare, there is a positive correlation, with Texas at the top having a poverty rate of 17.2 % with 24.9 % lacking healthcare, and Massachusetts at the bottom having a poverty rate of 11.6 % with only 4.6 % lacking healthcare in 2014. </p>

          <p>When you examine age vs. lack of healthcare, you see that majority of those without healthcare were between the 35 and 41 age range. Note that further examination of age with obesity or smoking reveals similar clustering within this same age range. </p>
          <p>You can see that states with higher median age were more likely to have healthcare insurance. States with higher median incomes and lower poverty rates tended to be healthier than those in poorer states. Overall, states with highest median age, highest household income and lowest poverty rates had better healthcare access. Please feel free to explore the data on your own and make your discoveries!</p>
